Required Features

Do the following exercises in sequential order. Similar to the lab, comments in the project will have tips and guide you throughout the exercises. Make sure to use the checkpoints as you go through the exercises to catch bugs early. All the changes you need to make are in BoardController.swift and ViewController.swift. Do not modify files in the DO_NOT_MODIFY folder

Objective 1: Change the number of letters in the word goal (Exercise 1)

Let's start by changing the number of letters our word guess will be! This will allow the game to be played with 4 letter words, 5 letter words, 6 letter words, and 7 letter words.

    Implement the applyNumLettersSettings function. Check out the hints in Exercise 1 and the hints below if additional help is necessary! It's ok if this part is confusing.

Objective 2: Change the number of letters in the word goal (Exercise 1)

Modifying this will increase the number of rows and allow you to play the game with fewer or more guesses.

    Implement the applyNumGuessesSettings function. Check out the hints in Exercise 2 and the hint below if additional help is necessary! It's ok if this part is confusing.

Objective 3: Change the word theme (Exercise 3)

Let's take this up a notch and allow us to select from a select pool of words! If you check out the WordGenerator swift file, you'll see the word options based on your theme selection!

    Implement the applyThemeSettings function. Check out the hints in Exercise 3 and the hint below if additional help is necessary! It's ok if this part is confusing.


Objective 4: Make the game harder!

Alien Wordle is for your extreme users. Everytime you guess the wrong word, the word resets!

    Implement the applyIsAlienWordleSettings function. Check out the hints in Exercise 4 and the hint below if additional help is necessary! It's ok if this part is confusing.
